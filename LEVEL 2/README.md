# Cognifyz Python Internship â€” Level 2

## Overview
This repository contains the Python projects I completed as part of Level 2 of the Cognifyz Python Internship.  
These tasks helped me improve my Python skills with practical applications.
## Tasks Completed

1. Guessing Game  
   - User guesses a random number within a range.

2. Number Guesser  
   - Computer guesses a number using binary search based on user feedback.

3. Password Strength Checker  
   - Checks password complexity (length, uppercase, digits, special chars).

4. Fibonacci Sequence Generator  
   - Generates Fibonacci numbers based on user input.

5. File Manipulation  
   - Demonstrates creating, reading, writing, and appending text files.
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Hithe21/Cognifyz_Python_Internship.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd Cognifyz_Python_Internship

3. Run any Python script for the tasks, for example:
python task1_guessing_game.py
python task2_number_guesser.py
python task3_password_strength_checker.py
python task4_fibonacci_sequence.py
python task5_file_manipulation.py
undefined
## Technologies Used and What I Learned

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: random, re  
- User input handling  
- File operations  
- Algorithm design (binary search, Fibonacci generation)  
- Basic security: password strength
